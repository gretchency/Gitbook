# Design Tic-Tac-Toe
tags: Google

```
Design a Tic-tac-toe game that is played between two players on a n x n grid.

You may assume the following rules:

A move is guaranteed to be valid and is placed on an empty block.
Once a winning condition is reached, no more moves is allowed.
A player who succeeds in placing n of their marks in a horizontal, vertical, or diagonal row wins the game.
```

```
Given n = 3, assume that player 1 is "X" and player 2 is "O" in the board.

TicTacToe toe = new TicTacToe(3);

toe.move(0, 0, 1); -> Returns 0 (no one wins)
|X| | |
| | | |    // Player 1 makes a move at (0, 0).
| | | |

toe.move(0, 2, 2); -> Returns 0 (no one wins)
|X| |O|
| | | |    // Player 2 makes a move at (0, 2).
| | | |

toe.move(2, 2, 1); -> Returns 0 (no one wins)
|X| |O|
| | | |    // Player 1 makes a move at (2, 2).
| | |X|

toe.move(1, 1, 2); -> Returns 0 (no one wins)
|X| |O|
| |O| |    // Player 2 makes a move at (1, 1).
| | |X|

toe.move(2, 0, 1); -> Returns 0 (no one wins)
|X| |O|
| |O| |    // Player 1 makes a move at (2, 0).
|X| |X|

toe.move(1, 0, 2); -> Returns 0 (no one wins)
|X| |O|
|O|O| |    // Player 2 makes a move at (1, 0).
|X| |X|

toe.move(2, 1, 1); -> Returns 1 (player 1 wins)
|X| |O|
|O|O| |    // Player 1 makes a move at (2, 1).
|X|X|X|
```
naive:矩阵扫一遍

高级：

* 用数组存每个row和col的状态，player1就给相应行和列加一，player2就减一，对角线和反对角线用一个数记录就行，看最后绝对值能否到n的长度，到了就赢了
* 反对角线：```row == size - col - 1```
* O(n) time complexity

```java
public class TicTacToe {
    int[] rows;
    int[] cols;
    int diagonal;
    int antiDiagonal;
    int size;

    /** Initialize your data structure here. */
    public TicTacToe(int n) {
        rows = new int[n];
        cols = new int[n];
        size = n;
    }
    
    /** Player {player} makes a move at ({row}, {col}).
        @param row The row of the board.
        @param col The column of the board.
        @param player The player, can be either 1 or 2.
        @return The current winning condition, can be either:
                0: No one wins.
                1: Player 1 wins.
                2: Player 2 wins. */
    public int move(int row, int col, int player) {
        int toAdd = player == 1 ? 1 : -1;
        rows[row] += toAdd;
        cols[col] += toAdd;
        if (row == col) diagonal += toAdd;
        if (row == size - col - 1) antiDiagonal += toAdd;
        
        if (Math.abs(rows[row]) == size || Math.abs(cols[col]) == size || 
        Math.abs(diagonal) == size || Math.abs(antiDiagonal) == size) return player;
        return 0;
    }
}

/**
 * Your TicTacToe object will be instantiated and called as such:
 * TicTacToe obj = new TicTacToe(n);
 * int param_1 = obj.move(row,col,player);
 */
